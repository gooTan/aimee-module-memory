    *
    * One edge for this relation, deliberately. The pass divides by a correlated
    * (SELECT MAX(weight) ... WHERE relation = ...), and postgres (production)
    * evaluates that against the statement-start snapshot while this suite's
    * shim (db2_test_shim = sqlite) re-evaluates it per row and sees its own
    * writes. With two edges the two backends disagree — 2,4 normalizes to 50,100
    * on postgres but 50,8 under the shim, since updating the first row raises the
    * max the second row divides by. A single edge has nothing to interfere with,
